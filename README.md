#CVE-Test
This is a tool that I created for the automation of network security audits. Feed it a file with hostname/IP addresses, it will perform an nmap scan of the servers, evaluate the CPE of the servers, and use that to determine CVE's to which the server may be vulnerable. 

##Exceptions:
* CentOS and RHEL backport security updates. This can cause false positives in cases where a security update has been backported to a seemingly outdated version of a service.
* nmap can not always reliably determine versions of software. This can cause large amounts of false positives, so it is possible to disable scans for CPE's that are known to experience this issue.
